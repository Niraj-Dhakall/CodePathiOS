## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
    Instagram- being able to add separate images within the image. I also like being able to add music to photos so you can share your favorite photos and favorite songs with people.
    Youtube- I like how you can shrink a video so you can do other things while multitasking. I also like how switching between devices and the videos you watch resume between devices.
    Snapchat - Taking videos and being able to add filters over it. Being able to zoom in with just one hand and being able to switch between photo and video by holding down the button.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
    I had some difficulty with getting the button to be in viewController class. But that was just because I didn't know where to drag it. Other than that it was simple because I had previous coding experience.
